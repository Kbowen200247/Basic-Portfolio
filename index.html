			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img id="bio-image" src="http://placehold.it/150x150" alt="bio-image">
			<p>My best skill is that I work hard at any language that is needed to complete a project. I am a very creative, technical professional who is skilled in a wide array of technologies which include web design, developing and programming. I have acquired close to seven years of experience with a desire to work on all types of projects. I have increased my skills by continuing to take classes to stay on the cutting edge including now the Case Western Reserve Web Developer Coding Boot Camp to cap off my professional journey.</p>

			<p>My capabilities are that I work well with others, pick up languages and work hard to complete all projects that I receive, my attendance is very good and I really do enjoy programming I have worked on both contracts and for individual companies and produced successful results for a variety of clients ranging from NASA, Veterans Administration to local businesses.Â I am very organized, have excellent work habits and the ability to multi-task several projects at once.</p>
